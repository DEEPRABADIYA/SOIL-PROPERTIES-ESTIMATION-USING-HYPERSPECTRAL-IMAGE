**Title** : **SOIL PROPERTIES ESTIMATION USING HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE**

This project focuses on predicting soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), and nutrient levels (e.g., Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, K, P₂O₅, S) 
using hyperspectral data spanning nearly 2000 bands (350–2450 nm). Machine learning algorithms and neural networks were trained to analyze this high-dimensional data, 
enabling accurate estimation of soil health indicators. The project demonstrates the potential of hyperspectral imaging in precision agriculture and soil management.
